Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,Another user put his new watch on for the first time and within 15 minutes was notified of a low heart rate that led to a necessary pacemaker.

Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"We are very pleased to report an all-time high for revenue with December quarter revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"We achieved all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and rest of Asia Pacific and grew in the vast majority of markets we track."

Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"In Vision Pro continues to see more use cases in enterprise, with Cisco's new spatial meetings delivering a fully immersive video conferencing experience for remote collaboration and learning."

Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,We ended the quarter with $141 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"We repaid $1 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8 billion, resulting in $97 billion in total debt."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"Therefore, net cash at the end of the quarter was $45 billion."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"During the quarter, we returned over $30 billion to shareholders."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,This included $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $23.3 billion through open market repurchases of 100 million Apple shares.
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results for the March quarter."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we're projecting today for the current quarter.
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"As the dollar is strengthened significantly, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 2.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"Despite that headwind, we expect our March quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid-single-digits year-over-year."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,We expect services revenue to grow low-double-digits year-over-year.
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"When you remove the negative impact of the foreign exchange headwinds I described earlier, the year-over-year growth rate would be comparable to that of the December quarter."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,We expect gross margin to be between 46.5% and 47.5%.
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,We expect operating expenses to be between $15.1 billion and $15.3 billion.
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on February 13, 2025, to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2025."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"With that, let's open to call the questions."
Suhasini Chandramouli,"Director, Investor Relations",We ask that you limit yourself to two questions.
Operator,Operator,"Certainly, we will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley."
Erik Woodring,Analyst,"Great guys, Thanks so much for taking my questions."
Erik Woodring,Analyst,"Tim, in your prepared remarks, you had noted that iPhone 16 models are selling better in markets where Apple Intelligence is available?"
Erik Woodring,Analyst,And I'm just wondering if you could double-click on that comment a bit and share any other details you believe could better help us understand how Apple Intelligence is really impacting iPhone demand and/or what features you find that users are using most often already?
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"The -- we did see that the markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those where Apple Intelligence was not available."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"In terms of the features that people are using, they're using all of the ones that I'd referenced in my opening comments from writing tools to image playground and Genmoji to visual intelligence and more."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,The cleanup is another one that is popular and people love seeing that one demoed in the stores as well.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"We only had 2, 2.5 weeks or so during the December quarter of the second release of [18.2] (ph) and then only had the U.K. and the other English language countries for the 2.5 weeks."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"And so we've got just the early indications at the moment, but we were glad…"
Erik Woodring,Analyst,"And then, you know, if we just touch on China, obviously, in the news fairly frequently, if we set aside China Macro, which I understand is still challenging, can you maybe talk about the headwinds that that Apple faces, whether that's, you know, shifting preferences for Western technology brands in favor of domestic vendors, or is this just a function of not necessarily having Apple intelligence available with the iPhone 16, which is, you know, not necessarily helping replacement cycles."
Erik Woodring,Analyst,"Just maybe double clicking on, on what you think and what you're hearing in China as a regard as it relates to the iPhone."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"If you look at our greater China revenue for the quarter, we were down 11% year-over-year."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,And over half of the decline that we experienced was driven by change in channel inventory from the beginning to the end of the quarter.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,And of course on the Apple intelligence side we have not rolled out in China and as we just talked about we did see better results in the markets that we had rolled out in than markets we hadn't rolled out in.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"And of course, it's the most competitive market in the world."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"In terms of the macro situation, there was a fiscal stimulus or subsidy announced in very recently in January that did not affect the December quarter."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"There were some provincial subsidies in the December quarter, but the national program was announced, I believe, on January 20."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"And it does cover the categories that we have products in from smartphones to tablets and PCs and smart watches up to a certain, a maximum price point."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,And so we do see fiscal stimulus occurring and we'll be glad to talk about what that looks like on the next call.
Operator,Operator,Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius.
Ben Reitzes,Analyst,"And, hey, Tim, I wanted to ask you who -- you knew this one was coming, but there's a perception that you're a big beneficiary of lower cost of compute and I was wondering if you could give your worldly perspective here on the DeepSeek situation and if you are going to, if you, if anything's happened to change your views in terms of a tailwind to margins and your ability to execute even due to the potential for cost to come down due to that development and probably what was going to happen anyway."
Ben Reitzes,Analyst,But I'd love your perspective on that and then have a quick follow-up.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"In general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"As you know, we do things on the device, and we do things in the private cloud and which mimics from a architectural point of view the -- what happens on the device."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"And from a CapEx point of view, we've always taken a very prudent and deliberate approach to our expenditure and we continue to leverage a hybrid model, which I think continues to serve us well."
Ben Reitzes,Analyst,"And then, you know, just with regard to, you know, the iPhone trajectory, do you feel like, I guess, what is -- you obviously don't talk about new products and stuff like that, but do you feel that there's a lot of room for form factor innovation in the future?"
Ben Reitzes,Analyst,Or do you feel that the current lineup kind of it shows where you're going?
Ben Reitzes,Analyst,"I guess without pulling punches wondering if you, you thought you know in terms of the phone innovation if there's a lot more to come and you could see the kind of current market changing a bit over the next two to three years."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"I think, Ben, I think there's a lot more to come and I could not feel more optimistic about our product pipeline."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,So I think there's a lot of innovation left on the smartphone.
Operator,Operator,Our next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Ng,Analyst,"First, it was encouraging to hear about the record for iPhone upgraders, which I think is something you haven't said for about a year now."
Michael Ng,Analyst,I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you would attribute this upgrade strength to?
Michael Ng,Analyst,Has Apple Intelligence played a role in helping upgrades in the markets that you've launched in?
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"If you look at iPhone, we did set an all-time record for upgraders, so we've never seen a higher level of upgraders before."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,The installed base hit a new all-time high as well.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"And if you look at the 16, compared to the 15 from launch, which occurred, as you know, in September, so this is across now two quarters from September to the end of the December fiscal quarter, the 16 outperformed the 15."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"And so I think you can conclude from that, that there are compelling reasons to upgrade."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"And in the markets where we had launched Apple Intelligence, they outperformed the markets that we did not."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, lots of good color there."
Michael Ng,Analyst,And then I had one about the iPad Pro and for the thinner version.
Michael Ng,Analyst,I was just wondering if you could talk about that thin form factor for the iPad Pro.
Michael Ng,Analyst,How did it help iPad sales overall and what did your kind of marketing consumer research tell you about how consumers valued that thin product form factor?
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,iPad overall grew 15% for the quarter and it was more driven by iPad Air and the entry level iPad than it was the top level iPad.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,But overall we could not be more pleased with the iPad category growing 15%.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,And probably what is most important is that over half of the sales in the December quarter went to customers who were new to the iPad.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,So that tells us that there's a good amount of customers there to attract.
Operator,Operator,Our next question is from Amit Daryanani from Evercore.
Amit Daryanani,Analyst,"Maybe to start with, you folks are seeing some very robust growth trends in emerging markets right now for Apple products?"
Amit Daryanani,Analyst,"Can you just add a high level, just talk about the durability of growth that you see in emerging markets?"
Amit Daryanani,Analyst,And then do you think the summation of these emerging markets are starting to get big enough or perhaps starting to grow fast enough that it can actually offset some of the China headwinds you're going through?
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,We have great results in a number of emerging markets.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"And as you know from past calls, I'm particularly keen on India."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,India set a December quarter record during the quarter.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,We've announced that we're going to open four new stores there.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"We also, the iPhone was the top selling model in India for the quarter."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,And it's the second largest smartphone market in the world and the third largest for PCs and tablets and so there's a huge market and we are -- we have very modest share in these markets.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,And that's just one of the emerging markets.
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"Yes, maybe I'll add, Amit, that in emerging markets we're also seeing double-digit growth on the install base, both in total and for the iPhone as well."
Amit Daryanani,Analyst,"And then, you know, just a question on gross margins for the March quarter."
Amit Daryanani,Analyst,You folks are guiding gross margin is flattish on a sequential basis.
Amit Daryanani,Analyst,"Typically, I think it tends to be guided up a little bit, 50 basis points, so sequentially."
Amit Daryanani,Analyst,"Can we just touch on like, what are the offsets of the puts and takes you see here on gross margins?"
Amit Daryanani,Analyst,"And Kevan, maybe you can just talked about its FX having an outsized impact in your margin profile as well in March?"
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"Yes, Amit, let me take that One."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"You know, as we mentioned in my remarks, we're guiding to 46.5% to 47.5%."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"So we think it's, you know, we're very pleased with that level of guidance."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"As you mentioned, there's always puts and takes."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"We do think there's going to be some FX headwinds, which we talked about, that's going to affect, you know, our revenue growth as well."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"You know, it'll have an impact here on the margin, a sequential impact on margins."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,But we think that's going to be offset by favorable costs and the relative mix of services.
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"We also, as you know, when we move from Q1 to Q2, especially on the product side, because Q1 is such a large quarter for a products business, we do have a loss of leverage."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"So there are some puts and takes, and I think we feel good about the range."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"We think it's a very, very strong guide for gross margin."
Suhasini Chandramouli,"Director, Investor Relations","Operator, could we get the next question, please?"
Operator,Operator,Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.
Wamsi Mohan,Analyst,"Tim, I want to follow-up on your comment about channel inventory in China."
Wamsi Mohan,Analyst,I was wondering if you could maybe address more broadly if channel inventory across your different product lines and regions?
Wamsi Mohan,Analyst,Do you feel they're elevated or out of range in any other regions?
Wamsi Mohan,Analyst,"And given the clearing event that kind of happened in China, I guess in the quarter, should we think of a more normal progression quarter-on-quarter into the March quarter in China in particular, and I will follow."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yes, I don't want to project sales for the current quarter by region, but if you if you look at the channel inventory and look at iPhone in the aggregate, so on a worldwide basis we're very comfortable with our channel inventory position in the -- in China my point was that our channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, and that was over half of the reduction in the reported results."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"And so if you look, part of the reason for that is that our sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.
Wamsi Mohan,Analyst,"And then maybe as my follow-up, your services growth has been very strong and I know you've kind of been navigating some pretty challenging regulatory burdens on the business globally."
Wamsi Mohan,Analyst,So how should investors think about maybe either a top line or margin headwind that let's say you're currently absorbing in your results that could potentially maybe reverse in a more balanced regulatory environment?
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"So I think one, I just wanted to kind of reiterate the fact that, you know, our services business had an all-time record for December quarter of 14%."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,And that was a one strength that we saw across all geographic segments and also was very broad base across all of our services.
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"So we have, as you know, a very broad services portfolio."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"And so we do see, you know, good momentum across the board."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"And as well, we continue to see increasing engagement across the customer base, across all of the service offerings, both transacting and paid accounts."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"We talked about reaching all-time highs, and we have over now 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services platform."
Suhasini Chandramouli,"Director, Investor Relations","Operator, could we get the next question, please?"
Operator,Operator,Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.
Samik Chatterjee,Analyst,"I guess for the first one, if I -- I mean, you had a great quarter on Macs and iPads both."
Samik Chatterjee,Analyst,"And I'm just curious, in terms of if you can help us think about the sustainability of this double-digit growth that you saw in both the product lines, and more interest are also here, we are talking about Apple Intelligence sort of influencing volumes on iPhones, but any thoughts on sort of how -- what does that influence look like in terms of volumes for Macs, for example, where I think there's a lot of conversation on AI PCs, how you're thinking about the impact there?"
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"If you look at Mac, Mac was up 16% and on iPad, we were up 15%."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,The Mac was driven by the very strong uptake on our new products during the quarter and the continued success of the MacBook Air.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"And so as you know, we've launched an M4-based MacBook Pro, an iMac and a Mac Mini during the quarter."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,We believe we've got the best AI PC out there for running workloads.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"The silicon in the Mac is, and it has been for several years now, designed by us and really designed for these workloads."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"And so I don't want to project at the category level for the future, but we're incredibly pleased with both the Mac and the iPad for the quarter."
Samik Chatterjee,Analyst,"And Tim, I'm going to use your earlier discussion about India as a strong emerging market to sort of ask you about the supply chain planning there in terms of how much of the supply chain planning there that you're doing is more of a reflection of the growth expectations from that market relative to in terms of diversification of the supply chain?"
Samik Chatterjee,Analyst,And how should we sort of think about that strategy in terms of that particular country?
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"If you look at the manufacturing we do there, we do manufacturing both for the domestic market, and we export."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,And so in -- our business needs a certain economies of scale for it to make sense to manufacture in country.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,And so that really means that we're going to be both a use for the domestic market and an export market.
Suhasini Chandramouli,"Director, Investor Relations","Operator, could we get the next question, please?"
Operator,Operator,Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS.
David Vogt,Analyst,I'm trying to think about your commentary around Apple Intelligence being sort of a momentum driver for the iPhone business.
David Vogt,Analyst,"But when I think about your kind of framework for the March quarter, if I kind of adjust for channel inventory over the last couple of years, kind of, feels like your iPhone revenue for the March quarter is going to be relatively similar to the quarter two years ago and even the quarter last year?"
David Vogt,Analyst,So how do we square kind of the momentum versus kind of the iPhone business effectively really kind of unchanged over the last couple of years?
David Vogt,Analyst,"And then second, when I think about kind of the gross margin profile of the business, obviously, you've done a great job in taking gross margins up."
David Vogt,Analyst,"Where do you think we sit in terms of, on the services side at least, where margins could go?"
David Vogt,Analyst,It looks like the 75% margin has been incredibly successful quarter.
David Vogt,Analyst,But just trying to get a sense for where do you think this number could go over the intermediate term?
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"If you look at Apple Intelligence, what my point earlier was, that markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence during the Q1 period performed better on a year-over-year basis than markets where we had not."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,And so that gives us -- it's a positive indicator that we were pleased with.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,There are many compelling reasons to upgrade.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"And the other thing I would say, that I think I mentioned earlier, is that if you look at it from a launch to the end of the December quarter, and so that goes back to September, the 16 family is outperforming the 15 family."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,And so I think those are two good data points.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,Our next round of language rollouts will be in April.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,And I'll let Kevan take the gross margin question.
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"So on the Services gross margin, I think maybe just stepping back a second."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,Services business in general in aggregate is accretive to the overall company margin.
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"And one of the things, as an important reminder, is we've got a very broad services portfolio."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,And those businesses have very different margin profiles.
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"And so I think, one, it's because of the nature of those businesses and in part also because of the way we account for them."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,And so one of the big factors that drive the Services gross margins and relative performance of those different businesses within the portfolio.
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"We also have the dynamic of some scale businesses like payment services, iCloud, that are actually growing."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"And there, when we add incremental users, those end up being accretive to margins as well."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"And so in general, what we saw in the December quarter was nice momentum across our entire services business that allows us to deliver that 75% margin at the services level."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"And I think our guidance takes into consideration what we think we're going to land from a company standpoint of 46.5% to 47.5%, which again, we think is a strong guide."
Operator,Operator,Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.
Krish Sankar,Analyst,"One, the first one for Tim."
Krish Sankar,Analyst,"You had very strong Mac growth, 16% year-over-year last quarter."
Krish Sankar,Analyst,Just wondering how much of that was driven by some of the Mac silicon innovation versus a replacement cycle for Macs?
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"I don't know the answer to your question precisely, but I think it is a combination of these products are so compelling, the M4-based products are so compelling, that it's driving both upgrades at the double-digit level and it's driving switchers at a double-digit level."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"And so we're seeing both come out, and I think it's just because of the compelling products."
Krish Sankar,Analyst,And then a follow-up for Kevan on the gross margin.
Krish Sankar,Analyst,I want to ask you on the product side.
Krish Sankar,Analyst,"Last quarter, you had 39.3%, which is very strong, similar to a year ago period."
Krish Sankar,Analyst,I'm kind of curious how much more levels do you have on the product side to improve the gross margin?
Krish Sankar,Analyst,"Or do you think with some of the more new AI-related devices, there's more upside to gross margin from here on the product hardware side?"
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"So on the product side, as you mentioned, we had pretty strong sequential improvement, 300 basis points, for the December quarter."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"That was really driven by, we talked about, favorable mix and leverage."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"As you know, in Q1, again, it's a launch quarter for many products, and so we tend to benefit from the leverage that we get from that higher volume."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"I would say, in general, our gross margin on products is driven by a number of factors."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,One of them is the various product launches that we have.
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,Different products do have different margin profiles.
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,And so that mix does make a difference.
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"And in particular, what we're seeing is, for example, many of our mix is across like phone, for example, we're seeing customers gravitate towards our Pro products because of things like affordability that allows our customers to get into our best products, which have favorable gross margins."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"So we're continuing to see that trend, that impacted us in the December quarter."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"As well, I think we're in a favorable commodity environment from a cost standpoint."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,And so we're benefiting from that as well in the December quarter.
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"And then that's going to be, as we talked about, we're going to have a foreign exchange headwind heading into the March quarter, but we figured that's contemplated in the guidance range that we gave, the 46.5% to 47.5%."
Suhasini Chandramouli,"Director, Investor Relations","Operator, could we get the next question, please?"
Operator,Operator,Our next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research.
Richard Kramer,Analyst,I'd like to ask about what might accelerate the pace of Apple Intelligence adoption.
Richard Kramer,Analyst,"I guess do you see this simply as a question of time i.e., to launch more markets and languages or increase the percentage of installed base devices that can support it?"
Richard Kramer,Analyst,"Or is it a question of money, i.e., shifting R&D or marketing spend towards AI?"
Richard Kramer,Analyst,"And based on other prior Apple services, do you expect a sort of tipping point where adoption will go mainstream?"
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,I do believe it will go mainstream.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,I'm getting feedback from people using different features today.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"And this is -- keep in mind that on the iPhone side of our business, you either have to have an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16 to use Apple Intelligence."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"And so the -- as that base grows, I think the usage will continue to grow."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"And I think -- I know from my own personal experience, once you start using the features, you can't imagine not using them anymore."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"I know I get 100s of e-mails a day, and the summarization function is so important."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"And of course, in April, we roll out a whole series of new languages that we had mentioned, and so the base grows further."
Richard Kramer,Analyst,"And then, Kevan, one of Luca's legacies was really getting Apple to record margin levels and also maintaining very consistent pricing across the product range."
Richard Kramer,Analyst,"But taking the current high levels of profitability as fairly stable, what observations might you share about price sensitivity of users and whether having a wider range of pricing across the products might unlocks potentially further market share gains or boost overall product growth?"
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"I think one, I don't think we're going to really depart from what served us pretty well to now."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"I mean we always take it into consideration, looking at short-term -- comparison between the short term and the long term."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,"I think we've had a pretty disciplined pricing strategy, which would serve us pretty well."
Kevan Parekh,Chief Financial Officer,And I think we're going to continually kind of stick with that as far as I can tell.
Suhasini Chandramouli,"Director, Investor Relations","Operator, could we get the next question, please?"
Operator,Operator,Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi.
Atif Malik,Analyst,How do you guys see the potential tariff impact to your product for consumer demand under Trump 2.0 you guys did find under Trump 1.0?
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,We are monitoring the situation and don't have anything more to add than that.
Atif Malik,Analyst,"And Tim, as a follow-up, there is a lot of discussion on agentic AI, the use of agents."
Atif Malik,Analyst,"Do you guys see the upgraded series expected in April as something that will, let's say, be the killer application among the suite of features that you have announced in Apple Intelligence?"
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,I think the killer feature is different for different people.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"But I think for most, they're going to find that they're going to use many of the features every day."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"And certainly, one of those is the -- is Siri, and that will be coming over the next several months."
Suhasini Chandramouli,"Director, Investor Relations","Operator, could we please get the last question?"
Operator,Operator,Our last question is from Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research Company.
Ben Bollin,Analyst,"Tim, I'm interested in your thoughts and how you would have us think about the average useful life of these devices in the wild."
Ben Bollin,Analyst,"And in particular, curious, if you look at the strength you saw in fiscal ‘21 and how that might support accelerated refresh opportunity into the future?"
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Ben, I think it's different for different types of users."
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,I mean you have very early adopter kind of users that are very quick to jump on the latest technology that upgrade very frequently.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,And then you have people that are on the entire opposite side of that barbell.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,And most people are between those two points.
Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"And so I do think there were lots of units that are sold during the COVID period of time, and it's a huge opportunity for us as a company to -- for more than one of the product categories."
